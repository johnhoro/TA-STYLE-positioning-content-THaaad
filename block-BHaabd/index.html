            in our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cata? in
            our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and
            storerooms, our farms. barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our
            granarios, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat
            markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they
            are in our ships, however, the rats of set them at defiance; still
            they are of great service
          </p>
          <p class="col-2">
            How wonderfuly patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,
            awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is
            their home! How well Shakespeare in Paricles, Act describes this
            keen attention of the cat toits natural pursuit
          </p>
          <p class="p2">
            The cat, with eye of burning coal, Now arouches from before the
            mouse's hole
          </p>
          <p class="col-2">
            A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth a quick, sharp,
            resolute motion and the cat has proved its usefuiness. Lat any one
            have a plaque of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be
            delivered therefrom by cats, as I was and they will have a lasting
            and kind gard for thems
